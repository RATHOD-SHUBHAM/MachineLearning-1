# Recommendation System.

## Designed and Implemented recommendation system in Python.

   - Built a Recommendation Engines that finds products that are most relevant to the user.
   - Used Movielens dataset, Pandas, Scipy and Numpy to build the system,

   ## Approach
   - Content based filtering : 
    - Content based filtering finds products relevant to a user - based on the content of the product (attributes, description, words etc).
   - Collaborative Filtering : 
    - Collaborative Filtering is a general term for an idea that users can help each other find what products they like. 
    - Today this is by far the most popular approach to Recommendations
  - Neighborhood models - also known as Memory based approaches:
    - rely on finding users similar to the active user. 
    - Similarity can be measured in many ways - Euclidean Distance, Pearson Correlation and Cosine similarity being a few popular ones.
  - Latent factor methods:
    - Identify hidden factors that influence users from user history. 
  - Matrix Factorization:
    - Matrix Factorization is used to find these factors.
