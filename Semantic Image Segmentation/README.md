# Semantic Image Segmentation.

Most of the time, I just experimented with object detection and recognition, which creates a bounding box around specific detected objects in an image. 
However, I later came across another technique that can give a precise outline of an object that has been detected in an image. 
This technique is known as Image Segmentation.
