# Machine Learning 💻

Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

## How machine learning works
  Step 1: Select and prepare a training data set.

  Step 2: Choose an algorithm to run on the training data set.

  Step 3: Training the algorithm to create the model.

  Step 4: Using and improving the model.



## Some Machine Learning Methods:
  Machine learning algorithms are often categorized as supervised or unsupervised.

  1. Supervised Machine Learning: 
        Supervised machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. 
  2. UnSupervised Machine Learning:
        In contrast, unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. 

## Reinforcement Machine Learning:
   Reinforcement Machine Learning algorithms is a learning method that interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovers errors or rewards.
